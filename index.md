## Selected Projects 

### Research Projects - Visual Information Processing
*<span style="color:lightblue">Psychometrics</span> | 
<span style="color:lightblue">Bayesian Models</span> | 
<span style="color:lightblue">Mathematical Approaches </span>*

To gain insights how visual perception works as an "unconscious inference" and how our brain uses computational representations to process visual information, I measure visual percepts of humans and reveal the underlying models.

### Daily progress in my PhD journey
*<span style="color:lightblue">Data Visualization</span> | 
<span style="color:lightblue">Interactive Dashboard</span>*

Approaching the end of my PhD, I set up a daily standup meeting and recorded my daily progress in a spreadsheet. This app is to visualize the data and help me to track my progress.

### Diabetes health indicator
*<span style="color:lightblue">Classification</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Model Tuning</span>*

Early diagnosis of diabetes is important to prevent the onset of complications. From survey data, I found health indicators that are most associated with diabetes.

### Symptoms to diagnosis using NLP
*<span style="color:lightblue">NLP</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Word Cloud</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Neural Network</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">TensorFlow</span>*

NLP seems becoming powerful in the field of healthcare. In this project, I explore how to infer disease from symptoms using language processing and neural networks.

### Rental offers in Munich 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Geodata</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Regression</span>* 

Hunting for a new apartment in Munich? I analyzed the data from [Immobilienscout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/) to find what factors affect the price of a rental offer in Munich.

### A Starter for Forecasting Time Series
*<span style="color:lightblue">Time Series</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Forecasting</span>*

Which methods are suitable for forecasting time series? I made a starter notebook to explore different models and find the best method to predict sales data.

### Music effects on mental health
*<span style="color:lightblue">Exploratory Data Analysis</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Correlation</span>*

How music affects our mental health? In this notebook, I used survey data to explore participants' music listening habits and mental health status.

## All Projects

### Forest Cover Type - Compare Classification Algorithms
*<span style="color:lightblue">Classification</span>* | 
*<span style="color:lightblue">Model Tuning</span>*

In this project, I predicted the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). I compared different classification models and applied hyperparameter tuning to the best model.

### Catch the CATs - Explore Feature Engineering
*<span style="color:lightblue">Exploratory Data Analysis</span>* |
*<span style="color:lightblue">Feature Engineering</span>*

In this project, I performed feature engineering on various features, including binary features, low- and high-cardinality nominal features, low- and high-cardinality ordinal features, and (potentially) cyclical features.

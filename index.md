## Research Projects - Visual Information Processing

To gain insights how visual perception works as an "unconscious inference" and how our brain uses computational representations to process visual information, I measure visual percepts of humans and reveal the underlying models.

## All Projects
### Forest Cover Type - Compare Classification Algorithms

In this project, I predicted the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). I compared different classification models and applied hyperparameter tuning to the best model.

### Catch the CATs - Explore Feature Engineering

In this project, I performed feature engineering on various features, including binary features, low- and high-cardinality nominal features, low- and high-cardinality ordinal features, and (potentially) cyclical features.

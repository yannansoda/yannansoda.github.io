## Visual Information Processing

_Research questions and solutions during my PhD in Neuroscience_


<!-- ### Inference in visual information processing -->

Perception is an "unconscious inference", stated by Hermann von Helmholtz, and believed by me, a scientist studying how our brain processes rich and ambiguous visual information.

It seems that, from the perspective of information processing, the brain is an information processor that never rests and implements statistical inference, for example, using Bayes rules and joint models.

<!-- ### My interests and works -->

I am particularly interested in the computational representations of the inference in our brain. 

To investigate them, I measure visual percepts of humans and reveal the underlying models. I have been coding psychophysical experiment programs in Python, applying statistical analysis on measurement data, using modeling and optimization techniques, and of course, being always eager to learn and try new ideas.

<!-- ### Outcomes -->
The research projects is still ongoing, which are expected to result in three research publications. 

I have published preprints and presented the findings in conferences - check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FD3M8jEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) if you are interested.

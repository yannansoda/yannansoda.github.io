## Visual Information Processing

_Research questions and solutions during my PhD in Computational Neuroscience_

<!-- ### Inference in visual information processing -->

Perception is an "unconscious inference", stated by Hermann von Helmholtz, and believed by me. 

From the perspective of information processing, the brain is an information processor that never rests but constantly implements statistical inference, for example, using Bayes rules and joint probabilities.

<!-- ### My interests and works -->

During my Ph.D. at the [Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences-LMU](https://www.gsn.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), I was particularly interested in the computational representations of the inference in our brain. 

To investigate them, I measured visual percepts of humans and revealed the underlying models. I design novel studies, coded psychophysical experiment programs, applied statistical analysis on measurement data, and extensively used modeling and optimization techniques.

<!-- ### Outcomes -->
The research projects have resulted in publications and presentations in conferences - check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FD3M8jEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) if you are interested.

## Catch the CATs

_My explorations of Feature Engineering_


### Project description

A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured. In this project, I performed feature engineering on various features, including binary features, low- and high-cardinality nominal features, low- and high-cardinality ordinal features, and (potentially) cyclical features.

## Forest cover type

_Comparing classification algorithms and explore hyperparameter tuning_

In this project, I predicted the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). I compared different classification models and applied hyperparameter tuning to the best model.
